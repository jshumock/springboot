# Coding Test
Our Application is largely configuration driven.  One of the configuration screens that was recently redesigned allowed us to configure which data sets are visible to which users.  I have provided a basic skeleton that renders a basic page and has stubbed out code to 
implement CRUD operations.  The data needs to be stored for different year/month time periods.  For example, Jan 2018 has a set of configs A,B,C,D.  However, Feb 2018 has the set of configs A,C,F,G,H. For convenience, you can use the string "022018" as Feb 2018 to avoid date code. Once you have it working, please submit your code by issuing a PR to master in the repo.

**Hint: There are a couple of bugs that will need to be corrected.**

### Minimum Requirements:
1. Display whatever is currently configured **(not having a configuration is not an error)** in a grid.
1. Add the ability to add new configurations for a time period.
1. Add the ability to delete all the configurations for a time period.

### Optional Requirements: 
1. Add the ability to remove a single configuration for a time period.

## Getting the Code and Running the App

1. Clone the newly forked repo (git clone <your repo address>)
1. Commit changes as you make them to your forked repo.

### Building and Running the App
1. In the configurationapp directory (under the directory you checked out the code to) run: mvn clean package.
1. In the configurationapp/target directory run: java -jar configurationapp.jar
1. In your favorite browser navigate to localhost:9000
